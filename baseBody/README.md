### Making your own accessories:
I've included my own drafted PEN-F body with both PEN-F and PEN-FT tripod attachment points. Measurements are based on both my F and FT. I've had to use my best judgement to interpret what the Olympus designers were thinking in the 60's when they were designing the PEF-F. It's as close as I think I can get it to a real PEN-F. And I believe it's a very good starting point if you want to make your own Pen-F asscessories. 

There are some issues with real world PEN-F and PEN-FTs. The base isn't flat; there's a slight curve. Over the decades the camera strap loops may have been damaged and are no longer aligned to where they once were installed.
