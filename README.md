### In this repository:
- [Pen-F L-Bracket + Grip](https://github.com/Archive-663/olympusPENF/tree/main/L-Bracket)
- [Pen-F baseModel](https://github.com/Archive-663/olympusPENF/tree/main/baseBody)

### Background Story:
The L-Bracket was designed because I needed a more reliable system for testing and using my [shift adapters](https://github.com/Archive-663/lensAdapters/tree/main/Olympus%20PEN-F). I picked up a broken PEN-FT as well to make sure the L-Bracket would be compatible with most of the PEN-F cameras. It's unconfirmed on the PEN-FV, but I think it has the same mounting point as th e PEN-FT. I modeled a similar ECG-4 type grip from the new Digital Pen-F and you also have the ability to make your own custom wood grips.

I've enjoyed using the L-Brackt + Grip on my own PEN-F. It only adds a little heft too body but it fits better in my hand now. You can run it without the Grip or the Side bracket but on the PEN-F the mounting point kind of make it a little wonky to use with just the Base Bracket.
